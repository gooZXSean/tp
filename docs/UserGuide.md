## 2. Quick start
<br>

### 2.1 Installation

1. Ensure you have [Java](#java) `17` or above installed in your computer (Follow the guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html)). <br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest [`.jar` file](#jar-file) from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/releases/latest).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the [_home folder_](#home-folder). This is the folder where you would like to keep the [`.jar` file](#jar-file) for access, and where the app will store its data files.

4. Open your search bar by pressing the Windows key (or the search button for Mac).

5. Open a command [terminal](#terminal) by typing "terminal" in the search bar and press "Enter". The command terminal is an app that is already in your computer.

6. Use `cd [folder path]` to navigate into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar estatemate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A [GUI (Graphical User Interface)](#gui) similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img src="images/Updated_GUI_v3.png" alt="Updated GUI v3" width="600">

7. Type a [command](#command) in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `tenant n/John Tan p/91234567 e/jtan@example.com a/Blk 123 #12-34, Bedok lease/2025-01-01 2026-12-31 r/2800.00 paydate/2025-01-01`:
      Adds a contact named `John Tan` to the application.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd tenant contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the application.<br>

<img src="images/help-window.png" alt="Help Window" width="657"> <br>

8. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.

<br>

### 2.2 User Interface Overview

Upon opening the application, you should see the following UI:
![annotated-GUI.png](images/annotated-GUI.png)

To input [commands](#command), use the input box at the top of the window.
The available commands will be explained below.

<br>

### 2.3 Understanding Command Prefix

In EstateMate, [commands](#command) use [**prefixes**](#prefix) to identify each [parameter](#parameter).  
Each prefix must be followed by a `/` and its corresponding value.

| **Prefix** | **Meaning**     | **Example Usage**             |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| `n/`       | Name            | `n/John Tan`                  |
| `p/`       | Phone Number    | `p/91234567`                  |
| `e/`       | Email Address   | `e/jtan@example.com`          |
| `a/`       | Address         | `a/Blk 123 #12-34`            |
| `lease/`   | Lease Start-End | `lease/2025-01-01 2026-12-31` |
| `r/`       | Amount          | `r/2800.00`                   |
| `paydate/` | PayDate         | `paydate/2025-01-01`          |
| `t/`       | Tag             | `t/friend`                    |
| `j/`       | Job Number | `j/2`                          |
| `d/`      | Description  | `d/Broken pipe`        |

💡**Tip:**<br>
Combine multiple prefixes in one command:<br>
`tenant n/John Tan p/91234567 e/jtan@example.com a/Blk 123 #12-34, Bedok lease/2025-01-01 2026-12-31 r/2800.00 paydate/2025-01-01`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the features available in **EstateMate**.  
It is designed to help property managers understand how to efficiently manage tenant information and maintenance jobs
through various [commands](#command).

Each feature is grouped by functionality:
- **Tenant Management** — Commands for adding, deleting, editing, and finding tenant details.
- **Maintenance Job Management** — Commands for creating, tracking, and updating maintenance jobs, including linking them to tenants.
- **General Utilities** — Commands for clearing data, exiting the application, and accessing in-app help.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #FFB300; background-color: #FFF8E1; padding: 15px;">
⚠️ <strong>Important Notes about Command Format:</strong><br><br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#parameter) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### 3.1 Tenant Management 
<br>

#### 3.1.1 Adding a Tenant: `tenant`
Adds a tenant to the application.

Format: `tenant n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS lease/START END r/AMOUNT paydate/PAYDATE [t/TAG]…​`

📌**Note:** 
- A tenant can have any number of tags, including zero.
- Address can only take up to 500 characters including spaces, symbols and punctuations.

Examples:
- `tenant n/John Tan p/91234567 e/jtan@example.com a/Blk 123 #12-34, Bedok lease/2025-01-01 2026-12-31 r/2800.00 paydate/2025-01-01`
- `tenant n/Sarah Kim p/12398653 e/sarahk@example.com a/Blk 234 #56-78, Clementi lease/2025-02-02 2027-02-02 r/4000.00 paydate/2025-02-02`

  ![before-add-v2.png](images/before-add-v2.png)
  <br><br>
  ![after-add-v2.png](images/after-add-v2.png)

<br>

#### 3.1.2 Deleting a Tenant: `delete`
Deletes the specified tenant from the application.

Format: `delete TENANT_NUMBER`

📌**Note:** 
- `TENANT_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each tenant in the tenant list, and must be a ***positive number*** between 1 and 2147483647.
- Only tenants that exist in the current displayed list can be deleted.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid red; background-color: #ffe6e6; padding: 15px;">

<strong>❗ Warning:</strong><br>
- This action is irreversible, data will be ***permanently deleted***.<br>
- Once a tenant is deleted, any links to jobs associated with that tenant will also be removed.
</div>
<br>

Examples:
- `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd tenant listed in the application.
- `find John` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st tenant in the results of the `find` command.

💡**Tip:**
- Use [`list`](#3-1-5-listing-all-tenants-list) or [`find`](#3-1-4-finding-a-tenant-find) first to confirm the correct tenant before deleting to avoid accidental removal.
- If you are deleting multiple tenants, consider double-checking indices after each deletion, as the list order updates dynamically.
<br>

#### 3.1.3 Editing a Tenant: `edit`

Edits an existing tenant in the application.

Format: `edit TENANT_NUMBER [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [lease/LEASE] [r/AMOUNT] [paydate/PAYDATE] [t/TAG]…​`

📌**Note:**
- `TENANT_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each tenant in the tenant list, and must be a ***positive number*** between 1 and 2147483647.
- Provide ***at least one*** parameter to edit.
- Tags are replaced, not added cumulatively; t/ clears all tags.
- You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
   specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st tenant to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
- `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd tenant to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.<br>

💡**Tip:**
- Use [`list`](#3-1-5-listing-all-tenants-list) or [`find`](#3-1-4-finding-a-tenant-find) first to confirm the correct tenant before editing to avoid overwriting important data. 
- When updating multiple parameters, include all changes in a single command to reduce errors.
<br>

#### 3.1.4 Finding a Tenant: `find`

Finds tenants whose names contain any of the given [keywords](#keyword).

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

📌**Note:**
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- Only the names of tenants are searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Tenants matching at least one keyword will be returned.
    e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
- `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
- `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`.<br>

💡**Tip:**
- Use specific keywords to narrow results, especially for common names.
- Combine multiple keywords when you want to search for multiple tenants at once.
<br>

#### 3.1.5 Listing All Tenants: `list`
Displays a list of all tenants currently stored in the application, ordered from the earliest added to the most recent.

Format: `list`

📌**Note:**
- Any additional input after `list` command will be ignored.
- `list` without any tenants will show you an empty list, hence you are recommended to add some tenants to the application before using this command.
<br><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2 Maintenance Job Management 
<br>

#### 3.2.1 Adding a Job: `job`
Adds a maintenance job to the application.

Format: `job d/DESCRIPTION`

📌**Note:**
- Provide a ***clear and concise*** description of the maintenance issue.
- Jobs can later be linked to tenants for easy tracking.
- Adding multiple jobs with the same description is allowed. This is useful when different units report the similar issues.

Examples:
- `job d/Water leakage in ceiling`
- `job d/Pipe leakage`<br>

💡**Tip:**
- Use consistent wording for similar issues (e.g., "Pipe leakage" vs "Leaking pipe") to make [finding](#3-2-4-finding-a-job-fjob) the job easier later on.
- Add jobs as soon as issues are reported to keep tenant records up-to-date.
<br>

#### 3.2.2 Deleting a Job: `djob`
Deletes a maintenance job from the application.

Format: `djob JOB_NUMBER`

📌**Note:**
- `JOB_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each job in the job list, and must be a ***positive number*** between 1 and 2147483647.
- Only jobs that exist in the current displayed list can be deleted.
- Deleting a job removes it from all tenants’ assigned job lists.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid red; background-color: #ffe6e6; padding: 15px;">

<strong>❗ Warning:</strong><br>
- This action is irreversible, the job will be ***permanently deleted***. 
- Once a job is deleted, any links to tenants associated with that job will also be removed, and it will no longer appear in the tenant’s job list.
</div>
<br>

Examples:
* `djob 2` deletes the job with job number 2 if it exists.

💡**Tip:**
- Use [`ljob`](#3-2-6-listing-all-jobs-ljob) to double-check the job number before deleting to avoid removing the wrong job.
- If you may need a record of the job later, consider [marking it as completed](#3-2-7-marking-job-as-completed-mark) instead of deleting it.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.2.3 Editing a Job: `ejob`
Edits a maintenance job in the application.

Format: `ejob JOB_NUMBER d/DESCRIPTION`

📌**Note:**
- `JOB_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each job in the job list, and must be a ***positive number*** between 1 and 2147483647.
- Only jobs that exist in the current displayed list can be edited.
- Provide a ***clear and concise*** description of the maintenance issue.
- Editing a job to match the description of another job is allowed. This is useful when different units report the similar issues.

Examples:
* `ejob 3 d/fix faucet` changes the description of the job with job number 3 to "fix faucet".

💡**Tip:**
- Use descriptive keywords in the description to make [finding](#3-2-4-finding-a-job-fjob) the job easier later on.
- You can quickly edit a job after using [`ljob`](#3-2-6-listing-all-jobs-ljob) to confirm the job number.

#### 3.2.4 Finding a Job: `fjob`
Finds maintenance jobs whose descriptions contain any of the given [keywords](#keyword).

Format: `fjob KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS]`

📌**Note:**
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `pipe` will match `Pipe`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Pipe leak` will match `leak pipe`
- Only the description is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Pipe` will not match `Pipes`
- Maintenance jobs matching at least one keyword will be returned.
   e.g. `Broken window` will return `Broken pipe`, `Window repair`

Examples:
- `fjob pipe` returns `pipe` and `Pipe Leakage`.
- `fjob aircon repair` returns `Aircon Leakage` and `Repair Pipe`.

💡**Tip:**
- Use specific keywords related to the job description to narrow down results, e.g., `pipe leakage` instead of just `pipe`.
- Combine multiple keywords for broader search if you’re unsure of the exact description, e.g., `aircon repair ceiling`.

#### 3.2.5 Linking Job to Tenant: `link`
Links a maintenance job to a specific tenant so that the job can be tracked alongside its relevant tenants.

Format: `link TENANT_NUMBER j/JOB_NUMBER`

📌**Note:**
- `JOB_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each job in the job list.
- You can only link jobs and tenants that already exist in the system.
- Once linked, the job will appear under the tenant’s assigned jobs in the display.
- Deleting a linked job will also remove it from the all tenants' assigned job lists.
- Marking and unmarking linked job will change the status of completion under tenant's assigned job list.

Examples:
- `link 1 j/2` links the 2nd maintenance job in the job list to the 1st tenant in the tenant list. 
<br>

  <img src="images/linked-job.png" alt="Linked Job" width="1200">
<br>

💡**Tip:**
- Link jobs as soon as they are created to keep tenants’ maintenance records accurate and avoid losing track of pending tasks.

#### 3.2.6 Listing All Jobs: `ljob`
Displays a list of all jobs currently stored in the application, ordered from the earliest added to the most recent.

Format: `ljob`

📌**Note:**
- Any additional input after `ljob` command will be ignored.
- Running the `ljob` command without any jobs stored in the application will show you an empty list, hence you are recommended to add some maintenance jobs before using this command.

#### 3.2.7 Marking Job as Completed: `mark`
Updates the status of a maintenance job to `Completed` so that you can track completed maintenance jobs easily.

Format: `mark JOB_NUMBER`

📌**Note:**
- `JOB_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each job in the job list, and must be a ***positive number*** between 1 and 2147483647.
- Once marked, the job status will be updated in the display under any linked tenant.
- If a job is marked by mistake, you can use the [`unmark`](#3-2-8-marking-job-as-not-completed-unmark) command to revert it to `Not Completed`.

Examples:
- `mark 2` updates the completion status of job number 2 of the job list to 'completed'.
<div style="display:flex; gap: 10px">  <img src="images/marked-tenantlist.png" alt="Marked Tenant List" width="457">
  <img src="images/marked-joblist.png" alt="Updated GUI v2" width="492">
</div>
<br>

💡**Tip:**
- Use [`ljob`](#3-2-6-listing-all-jobs-ljob) to double-check the job list before using `mark` to ensure you’re updating the correct job.
- Use [`unmark`](#3-2-8-marking-job-as-not-completed-unmark) to revert mistakes if a job is accidentally marked as not completed.

#### 3.2.8 Marking Job as Not Completed: `unmark`
Reverts a maintenance job's status to `Not Completed` in case it was marked as complete by mistake.

Format: `unmark JOB_NUMBER`

📌**Note:**
- `JOB_NUMBER` is the index displayed next to each job in the job list, and must be a ***positive number*** between 1 and 2147483647.
- Once unmarked, the job will no longer appear as completed.

Examples:
- `unmark 3` updates the status of job number 3 in the job list back to not completed.

💡**Tip:** 
- Use [`ljob`](#3-2-6-listing-all-jobs-ljob) to double-check the job list before using `unmark` to ensure you’re updating the correct job.
- Use [`mark`](#3-2-7-marking-job-as-completed-mark) to revert mistakes if you accidentally `unmark` a job.

<br>

### 3.3 General Utilities 
<br>

#### 3.3.1 Clearing All Tenants: `clear`
Removes **ALL** tenants from the application.

Format: `clear`

<div style="border-left: 4px solid red; background-color: #ffe6e6; padding: 15px;">

<strong>❗ Warning:</strong><br>
This action is irreversible, all data will be ***permanently deleted***. Make sure you have backed up any important tenant or job information before using this command.
</div>
<br>

💡**Tip:** Use `clear` only when you want to start fresh or reset your tenant list.

## 5. FAQ and Known Issues
<br>

### 5.1 FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: 
1. [Install EstateMate](#2-1-installation) on your other computer.
2. On your original computer, navigate to the [home folder](#home-folder). This is the folder where the EstateMate app `estatemate.jar` is stored. 
3. You should see a folder named `data`. Copy this folder into your other computer. 
4. In your other computer, navigate to the [home folder](#home-folder). Find the folder named `data` and delete it. Replace it with the folder you copied over from your original computer.

<br>

### 5.2 Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the EstateMate app will open off-screen. The remedy is to navigate to the [home folder](#home-folder), find the file named `preferences.json` and delete it before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
