## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TenantListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**

* `MainWindow` stores a reference to a `Model` interface instance. This is to pass the `Model` instance to
  `TenantListPanel` as well as to retrieve job information for `JobListPanel`.
* `TenantCard` has a stronger association with the `Model` component because it stores a reference to a `Model`
  interface instance. However, this is used only retrieve and display jobs linked to a tenant.
  </box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTenantCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an **`EstateMateParser`** object which in turn
   creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteTenantCommandParser` or `AddJobCommandParser`) and uses it to
   parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteTenantCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a tenant or add a job).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the **`EstateMateParser`** class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddTenantCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddTenantCommand`) which the **`EstateMateParser`**
  returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddTenantCommandParser`, `DeleteTenantCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the
  `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/model/Model.java)
<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the EstateMate data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both EstateMate data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EstateMateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.estatemate.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Job feature

#### Implementation Overview

This section explains how **Jobs** are modelled, parsed, stored, and presented.

#### Model

**Core Types**

* `Job` fields: `id:int`, `description:Description`, `isDone:boolean`.
* `Description` validates non-blank descriptions.
* `UniqueJobList` maintains all jobs; provides add/remove/mark/unmark and an unmodifiable observable view.

**Tenant References**

* `Person` keeps `List<Integer> jobs` (job **ids**).
* Deleting a job **cascades**: the job is removed and its id is stripped from all persons’ `jobs` lists.

<puml src="diagrams/JobModelClassDiagram.puml" width="360" />

#### Logic

**Commands**

* `AddJobCommand` (`job d/<desc>`) parses `Description`, allocates id via `Model#nextJobId()`, adds job.
* `EditJobCommand` (`ejob <id> d/<desc>`) updates job **description** for the given id; preserves `isDone`.
* `DeleteJobCommand` (`djob <id>`) removes job and triggers cascade unlink from tenants.
* `MarkJobCommand` / `UnmarkJobCommand` (`mark <id>` / `unmark <id>`) toggles completion.
* `FindJobCommand` (`fjob KEYWORDS…`) filters by case-insensitive keywords with `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

**Parsers**

* `AddJobCommandParser`, `EditJobCommandParser`, `DeleteJobCommandParser`,
  `MarkJobCommandParser`, `UnmarkJobCommandParser`, `FindJobCommandParser`
  tokenize arguments, validate fields, and construct commands.

**Post-mutation behaviour**

* After any mutation, `ModelManager` resets the filter to `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_JOBS`.

<puml src="diagrams/JobAddSequence.puml" width="900" />

#### Storage

**JSON Mapping**

* `JsonAdaptedJob` <-> `Job` with fields  
  `{ "id": number (>0), "description": string, "isDone": boolean }`.
* `JsonSerializableEstateMate` rejects duplicates by id. Jobs with the same description are allowed and will all be loaded. Load errors surface as
  `DataLoadingException`; the app then starts with an **empty** dataset (AB-3 fallback path).

**Save Flow**

* After a successful command, `LogicManager` persists via `StorageManager#saveEstateMate(...)`.

<puml src="diagrams/JobStorageDiagram.puml" width="640" />

#### UI

**Lists & Cards**

* `JobListPanel` renders the `ObservableList<Job>`.
* Each `JobCard` shows index, `id`, `description`, and a completion badge derived from `isDone`.
* The list updates automatically when `ModelManager`'s `filteredJobs` changes.

<puml src="diagrams/JobUiClassDiagram.puml" width="360" />

---

**Design Notes**

* **Safe startup**: duplicate jobs in storage (by id) cause load to fail; the app falls back to **empty**
  data.
* **Consistency**: job deletion removes any references from tenants (by id) to keep the model coherent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Proposed features**

This section describes some noteworthy proposed features that may be implemented in the future.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`— Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`— Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`— Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and
`Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be
saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `tenant n/David …​` to add a new person. The `tenant` command also calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will
not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once
to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no
previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the
case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address
book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()`
to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus,
the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `tenant n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Linking jobs to a tenant

1. Linking an existing tenant and job to each other
    1. Prerequisites: List all tenants using the `list` command. At least one tenant in the list. List all jobs using
       the `ljob` command. At least one job (job id: 1) in the list.

    2. Test case: `link 1 j/ 1`
       **Expected:** Job is linked to the tenant. Status message shows the job number and name of tenant linked. Job is
       displayed in the tenant's maintenance information section.

2. Linking a nonexistent tenant and a job to each other.
    1. Prerequisites: List all tenants using the `list` command. At most 4 tenants in the list. List all jobs using the
       `ljob` command. At least one job (job id: 1) in the list.

    2. Test case: `link 5 j/ 1`

       **Expected:** Job is not linked to the tenant. Error details showing in status message indicating invalid job
       index.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 5 <br>

1. Implement split screen display. (Allow both job lists and tenant lists to be displayed at the same time)
2. Allow tenant names to support special/non-ASCII characters. (Not just alphanumeric characters and spaces)
   - Allow for valid names like `Anne-marie`, `O'Brien`, `José` .
3. Improve tenant duplicate detection to include consideration for phone numbers.
   - Allows same name, as long as the phone number is different.
4. `help` command to show a quick, brief reference to available commands without the need to access external links.
5. Enhance `find` command to no longer require full words to match.
   - e.g. `find Ale` will display the tenant `Alex Yeoh`.
6. Enhance `fjob` command to no longer require full words to match.
   - e.g. `fjob leak` will display the job with description `Pipe leakage`.
7. Add a command to unlink a job from a tenant. (Reverse of existing `link` command)
8. Perform more refined parsing validation for the `tenant` command, specifically involving the `a/` tag. 
   - Currently, an address field of `a/ a/` is not accepted, while one of `a/a/` is accepted. 
9. Perform more rigorous validation of special character positions in phone numbers in the `tenant` command
    - e.g. Phone numbers like `999(())9999` or `99-----9` should be rejected.

## **Appendix: Effort**

The effort required and difficulty level was high, as we generally did not reuse any code (except for 1 method adapted
from StackOverflow). <br>
While AB3 deals with only one entity type (Persons), EstateMate needs to handle two (Tenants and Jobs). The tenant class
is also much more detailed with more fields compared to the Person class from AB3.

### Project Achievements

1. **Adding jobs and their related functionality** <br>
   Challenges:
    1. Finding a way to implement the storage for job data without interfering with the existing data storage for
       tenants.
    2. Switching to non-index based commands for jobs as having both index based commands for tenants and jobs could
       cause issues.
    3. Creating a whole new GUI section and components for displaying of jobs separately from tenants.
       <br>
2. **Adding additional fields to the existing `add` command to allow for adding tenants** <br>
   Challenges:
    1. Performing date parsing and verification, as Tenant has fields requiring dates while Person from AB3 does not.
       There are many edge cases to consider and thus this aspect is error-prone.
    2. Adding job-related methods and fields to the model for tenants while maintaining high cohesion simultaneously.
       <br>
3. **Adding a new GUI screen to accommodate the addition of jobs** <br>
   Challenges:
    1. Starting from scratch as AB3 only has one screen to manage, while we have two.
    2. Managing the switching between screens based on commands, which we also needed to implement from scratch.
